    aboutme: "Hi, I'm Ali. My life is a mix of different passions and big changes.\nI grew up in Iran, where I loved playing football and was studying civil engineering. Football taught me to work with others and to keep going, even when it's tough. Civil engineering taught me how to solve problems. But deep inside, I was always excited about something more creative and tech-related. This interest became clear when I got injured in football and realized during my civil engineering internship that I really liked the digital world more than building things. So, I decided to study design and programming at Fontys University in Eindhoven. This was a big change for me, moving from Iran to a new country and a new field of study.",
