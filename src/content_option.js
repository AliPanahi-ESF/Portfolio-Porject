    aboutme: "Hi, I'm Ali. My life is a mix of different passions and big change s. I grew up in Iran, where I loved playing football and was studying civil engineering. Football taught me to work with others and to keep going, even when it's tough. Civil engineering taught me how to solve problems. But deep inside, I was always excited about something more creative and tech-related. This interest became clear when I got injured in football and realized during my civil engineering internship that I really liked the digital world more than building things. So, I decided to study design and programming at Fontys University in Eindhoven. This was a big change for me, moving from Iran to a new country and a new field of study. At Fontys, I started learning the basics of design and programming. I used tools like Figma and Adobe and learned web languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I did a project where I made a website for a client. This project helped me use what I learned in a real way. I also learned a lot about myself at Fontys. I learned how to work alone and with others, to think creatively, and to enjoy challenges. I chose to focus on making mobile apps and learned about branding and marketing too. In my internship at a company called Edorado, I used my design skills in real projects. This experience taught me a lot.",
